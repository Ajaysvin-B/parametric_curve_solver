Parametric Curve Solver

This repository contains the complete solution and Python implementation for determining the unknown parameters in a parametric equation using a given set of (x, y) data points.
The task involves fitting the parameters 
𝜃
θ, 
𝑀
M, and 
𝑋
X to minimize the difference between the calculated and given data.
